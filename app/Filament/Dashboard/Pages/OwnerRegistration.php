// OwnerRegistration page removed: use the central web registration (/register) instead.
// Keeping this file as a placeholder prevents fatal class declaration conflicts during development.

// If you need a Filament-based registration page later, implement it carefully
// and ensure it does not conflict with the web /register route. For now,
// business-owner registration is handled via `routes/web.php` -> RegisteredUserController.
